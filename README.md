## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS (Sass/SCSS)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Splide.js](https://splidejs.com/) - JS Carousel library

### What I learned

I've worked with libraries before in **Python**, but this was one of my first times using a 3rd party library in **JS**. It made me realize yet again how important clear documentation is. It took me a while to understand the documentation and figure out how to get the library set-up and ready to use. The actual utilization part was better documented and fairly simple. 

I also played with creating event listeners in **JS**! I now recognize truly how powerful the ability to manipulate **HTML** via the **DOM** is. I want to explore this more and try to use **JS** instead of **HTML** when I can in the future.

### Continued development

I want to understand more about creating modular code in vanilla JS as well as **library import/export**. I love working with libraries now and I want to work with more in the future! I've had my eye on [Anime.js](https://animejs.com/) for a while now.
