<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://rboz1.github.io/furniture_webpage/#)

I've worked with libraries before in **Python**, but this was one of my first times using a 3rd party library in **JS**. It made me realize yet again how important clear documentation is. It took me a while to understand the documentation and figure out how to get the library set-up and ready to use. The actual utilization part was better documented and fairly simple. 

I also played with creating event listeners in **JS**! I now recognize truly how powerful the ability to manipulate **HTML** via the **DOM** is. I want to explore this more and try to use **JS** instead of **HTML** when I can in the future.

I want to understand more about creating modular code in vanilla JS as well as **library import/export**. I love working with libraries now and I want to work with more in the future! I've had my eye on [Anime.js](https://animejs.com/) for a while now.
