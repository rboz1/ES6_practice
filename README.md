## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS (Sass/SCSS)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Splide.js](https://splidejs.com/) - JS Carousel library

### What I learned

I've worked with libraries before in **Python**, but this was one of my first times using a 3rd party library in **JS**. It made me realize yet again how important clear documentation is. It took me a while to understand the documentation and figure out how to get the library set-up and ready to use. The actual utilization part was better documented and fairly simple. 

I also played with creating event listeners in **JS**! I now recognize truly how powerful the ability to manipulate **HTML** via the **DOM** is. I want to explore this more and try to use **JS** instead of **HTML** when I can in the future.

### Continued development

I want to understand more about creating modular code in vanilla JS as well as **library import/export**. I love working with libraries now and I want to work with more in the future! I've had my eye on [Anime.js](https://animejs.com/) for a while now.
